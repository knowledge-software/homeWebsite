Just someone.""Ah."-- Arthur and Ford, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy%%<font color="#006400">&gt;consult guide about <b><i>the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i></b></font> <font size=-2>The Guide checks through its Sub-Etha-Net database and eventually comes upwith the following entry:</font>The Hitchhiker's Guide is a wholly remarkable product. But then again youmust already know that, since you bought one.%%<font color="#006400">&gt;consult guide about <b><i>towels</i></b></font> A towel is the most useful thing (besides the Guide) a Galactic hitchhikercan have. Its uses include travel, combat, communications, protection fromthe elements, hand-drying and reassurance. Towels have great symbolicvalue, with many associated points of honour. Never mock the towel ofanother, even if it has little pink and blue flowers on it. Never dosomething to somebody else's towel that you would not want them to do toyours. And, if you borrow the towel of another, you MUST return it beforeleaving their world.%%<font color="#006400">&gt;consult guide about <b><i>fluff</i></b></font> Fluff is interesting stuff: a deadly poison on Bodega Minor, the dietstaple of Frazelon V, the unit of currency on the moons of the Blurfoidsystem, and the major crop of the laundry supplies planet, Blastus III.One ancient legend claims that four pieces of fluff lie scattered aroundthe galaxy; each forming one-quarter of the seedling of a tree with amazingproperties, the sole survivor of the tropical planet Fuzzbol (Footnote 8).The ultimate source of fluff is still a mystery, with the scientificcommunity torn between the Big Lint Bang theory and the White Lint Holetheory.<font color="#006400">&gt;footnote 8</font>It's not a very good legend, is it?<font color="#006400">&gt;yes</font>That was just a rhetorical question.%%<font color="#006400">&gt;consult guide about <b><i>Earth</i></b></font> Mostly harmless.%%<font color="#006400">&gt;consult guide about <b><i>space</i></b></font> If you hyperventilate and then empty your lungs, you will last about thirtyseconds in the vacuum of space. However, because space is so vastly hugelymind-bogglingly big, getting picked up by another ship within those thirtyseconds is almost infinitely improbable.%%<font color="#006400">&gt;consult guide about <b><i>matter transference beams</i></b></font> A thoroughly unpleasant means of travelling which involves tearing youapart in once place and slamming you back together in another. (Of course,it's better than the older method, where disassembled people would betransmitted down phone lines and arrive in a garbled and sometimescompletely disconnected state.) You should have a drink or two or threebefore going through one.

This text is currently the subject of thebiggest suit for criminal negligence damages in history and is unavailableat this time.%%<font color="#006400">&gt;consult guide about <b><i>alcohol</i></b></font> Alcohol, in addition to its familiar enjoyable effects, also helps cushionthe shock of matter transference beams.%%<font color="#006400">&gt;consult guide about <b><i>protein</i></b></font> Sources of protein, such as the common peanut, are carried by all serioushitchhikers. Protein loss occurs in matter transference beams and you willbecome groggy unless you replace it immediately.%%<font color="#006400">&gt;consult guide about <b><i>Vogons</i></b></font> <font size=-2>The Guide checks through its Sub-Etha-Net database and eventually comes upwith the following entry:</font>Vogons, whose specialties are bureaucracy and planet-smashing, are the mostunpleasant race in the galaxy. They wouldn't think twice about throwingsomeone into space, and wouldn't lift a finger to save their owngrandmother from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.

Here is an example ofhow stupid it is: it thinks that if you can't see it, it can't see you.Its behavior would be quite endearing if it wasn't spoilt by this onething: it is the most violently carnivorous creature in the Galaxy.

There is something highly suspectabout the water on Santraginus Five, as anyone who's ever met any of theirfish will tell you.%%<font color="#006400">&gt;consult guide about <b><i>Electronic Sub-Etha Auto Hitching Thumb</i></b></font> <font size=-2>The Guide checks through its Sub-Etha-Net database and eventually comes upwith the following entry:</font>The Electronic Sub-Etha Auto Hitching Thumb is a wonderful thing, butshould not be mistreated. If used while a ship is near, you will betransported there. If no ship is in the vicinity, you will place a heavystrain on the Thumb's logic circuits, which could lead to malfunction.

The most popular definition appears in the Sirius CyberneticsCorporation android manuals: "Intelligence is the ability to reconciletotally contradictory situations without going completely bonkers ? forexample, having a stomach ache and not having a stomach ache at the sametime, holding a hole without the doughnut, having good luck and bad lucksimultaneously, or seeing a real estate agent waive his fee."%%consult guide about time travel<font size=-2>The Guide checks through its Sub-Etha-Net database and eventually comes upwith the following entry:</font>Sorry, that portion of our Sub-Etha database was accidentally deleted lastnight during a wild office party.

In cases of majordiscrepancy, it's always reality that's got it wrong.%%The Guide is definitive.  Reality is frequently inaccurate.%%One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand abouthuman beings was their habit of continually stating and repeating the obvious,as in It's a nice day, or You're very tall, or Oh dear you seem to have fallendown a thirty-foot well, are you alright? At first Ford had formed a theory toaccount for this strange behaviour. If human beings don't keep exercisingtheir lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up. After a few months'consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one.If they don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains startworking. After a while he abandoned this one as well as being obstructivelycynical and decided he quite liked human beings after all, but he alwaysremained desperately worried about the terrible number of things they didn'tknow about.%%"I think someone's drunk," muttered a purple bushlike being into hiswineglass.%%Arthur felt happy.  He was terribly pleased that the day was for once workingout so much according to plan.
